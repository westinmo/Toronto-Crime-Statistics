**Overview**

This repo contains R scripts and an RMarkdown file used to analyze data on crimes reported between the years 2014 and 2019 in Toronto, using data obtained from the [Toronto Police Service Annual Statistic Report](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/asr-analytics). The purpose of this report was to assess police performance and crime trends in Toronto, and to examine biases in how crimes are reported.
